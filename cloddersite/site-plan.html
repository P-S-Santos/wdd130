      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The official Clodder Commemoration Org (henceforth referred to as CCO) pages will be the main go-to for anyone curious to learn more about the discovery of the Clodder organism and its ever-rippling impact on the world and mankind as a whole. This site aims to inform about the historical and contemporary significance of Clodder, and to inspire and invite one and all to join in celebration of the miracle organism!
      </p><p>
        The website will consist of 3 pages, namely: the home page, the history page, and the activities page. The homepage will serve as a hub for the other pages, inviting users to browse freely and giving an overview of the site's contents. The history page will provide users with a historically accurate telling of the discovery of Clodder and the founding of CCO. The activities page will list a number of commemorative activities that can be done in celebration of the discovery of Clodder, including visiting monumental landmarks, educational musea, but most importantly: attending the nation-wide Clodder Conventions!

      <h3>History page</h3>
      <p>
        This page will provide users with historical information about Clodder. There will be multiple informative paragraphs with historically important imagery to inspire awe in the readers.
      </p><p>
        To give a brief overview here, the Clodder organism was actually originally encountered by the Dutch in the early 1900's, but the true process of its discovery would happen only many decades later. When another ofshoot was encountered by England's most talented and brilliant scientists in the late 70's, the process of understanding the amazing creature's true nature had truly begun. With the Clodder research's increasingly booming development, our organization was established in 1999 to guide the masses to better understand the ever-expanding knowledge about the miracle organism. Now, Clodder has grown to be recognized as an effective medicinal curative, a beneficial dietary component, and a creature capable of deep emotional connection with humans, among many other things. Clodder has truly made the world a better place.

      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <p>
        Here, users will be able to see our most recommended Clodder-commemorative activities to partake in. Travel abroad to visit historical Clodder-related landmark locations, such as the very shores from which the Dutch fishermen who first encountered Clodder set sail in the Netherlands, or perhaps the British Clodder Museum in Oxford, including a tour of the Clodder-assigned scientific institutes and facilities. 
      </p><p>  
        For those that seek to participate in activities closer to their homes, we also inform the users of our globe-wide Clodder Conventions, where all the Clodder-curious can join together in fun and edifying Clodder-themed festivities, as well as panels and Q/A forums led by important figures in the Clodder-verse. Users can follow a link to a Clodder Con e-ticket booth to book a visit to the nearest Clodder Con (dummy link to dummy page).

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The grey spaces to the sides mean that the window can stretch beyond the maximum width of the central elements. On lower widths (like when viewing the pages on a smartphone), de central elements should fit snugly width-wise, and scale down and up to a certain degree. Contemplating putting a simplistic tiled background in the grey space.

        Also, in the footer, the three images are logos for the different social media sites: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter
      </p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>         
        I'd like to make the individual paragraphs start with the header font (in the first phrase), and continue with the body font.

      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <p>         
        Both the activities page and the home page will have dummy links to book tickets for the Clodder convention.
