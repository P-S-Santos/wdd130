                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>Our history with Clodder goes back to the quaint fishing village of Vissersdorp, near the north-western shores of the Netherlands. The organism was discovered by a small group of humble fishermen hauling in their daily catch in the early 1970's, marking mankind's true first contact with Clodder.</p>

                    <h2>It was only decades later, however, </h2>
                    <p>that we truly began to understand Clodder's magnificence, when an offshoot was discovered on British shores. Mereford scientists and scholars were the first to research the organism and pioneered the Clodder Studies in 1991, sparking global curiosity and academic interest in Clodder's mysteries. Currently, there exist 219 major Clodder-related scientific research operations and an ever-growing number of Clodder Studies Degree programs in universities across the globe.</p>

Wishing to spread the knowledge of Clodder to even the humblest households, a group of fervent individuals came together and founded the Clodder Commemoration Organisation in 1999, whose sole purpose is to serve as Clodder-ambassadors, and complete the bridge between the world and the miracle organism. Nowadays, the CCO is also a proud sponsor of the Clodder Proliferation Initiative, making Clodder research an products more widely available.</p>

Recent studies even indicate that Clodder has a high psycho-emotional compatibility with humans, meaning we'll soon be seeing specially developed strains of Clodder that can be kept as pets, capable of providing mental and emotional support, not unlike a service animal. Clodder has truly become an inseparable part of us.</p>
