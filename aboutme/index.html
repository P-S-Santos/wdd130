    <h1>Hey, nice to meet you!</h1>
    <h2>Let me introduce myself.</h2>

    <h2>I'm Pedro.</h2>
    <p>I was born in Portugal 28 years ago, raised in the Netherlands, and am currently living in Germany with my lovely wife, Amy. I've also served a mission in Japan and studied at BYU Provo for a year, so I've been all over the place. Who knows where I'll be next?</p>
    <p>I like to create stuff! Digital art, music, games... I love to make things that come to life and benefit people, which is why coding seems so interesting to me. I'm currently studying software dev and web dev at BYUI, and so far, I've been loving every second of it. </p>
    <p>Finally, I'm an absolute pizzafiend. I have a monstrous love for pizza. My personal favorites are calzone and... gulp... pizza Hawaii. What's your kinda pizza?</p>
    <h2>Looking forward to learning and working together with all of you :D</h2>
